1. Personalized medicine
   - Literature has thus far been limited (as if older adults are [homogenious](https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/56/3/M146/545770))
   - Patient or Case-mix dependent inference (individual consent derived from single parameter)
   - Sort of Public Health style (clinical trial literature is no different)
2. WebApp
   - Demographics (age, etc)
   - Exam (frailty phenotype)
   - Labs (inflammatory markers)
3. Deployment
   - Not a onetime thing (i.e., not truth, frequentist)
   - Iterations (i.e., freq updates, bayesian)
   - Neural networks capable of RLHF (credibility intervals)
4. RDC/NCHS Access Tokens
   - Compute: e(b), e(V) sizes
   - Iterations
   - Updates
5. Vince
6. GitHub
   - Transparency
   - Free
   - `.js` & `.html` vs. strimlit
