### Dionysus 1, 2, 3
- **Challenges**: Siri has semantic index across apps, devices, and OS without compromising [privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#Privacy)
- **Skills**: Inputs languages, images, and actions from personal context into neural & diffusion networks 

### Sing O Muse [4](./gpt-4o.md)
- **Tools**: In-house `A17` silicon, local, private, secture, no data storage, real-time usage
- **Agency**: Private cloud compute, server-based models, for elevated and secure experience beyond your device 

### Apollo 5
- **Realtime**: Across [xOS](https://abikesa.github.io/apple/os.html), data never stored, encrypted when leveraging SBMs in cloud
- **GPT**: Surface info from neuralnetwork shared for world knowledlge relevant to personal context
